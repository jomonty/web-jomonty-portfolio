        "Hi! My name is Josh Montgomery, and I'm a Glasgow based software developer.",
        "After working in Utilities for several years, I was coming to the realization that I enjoyed using the tools I was using to do my job more than my regular work and this built an ambition to transfer into software development.",
        "I began to teach myself through self-guided study, oneline courses, and building some personal projects, and the more time I spent studying the more I became convinced that this was the career for me.",
        "In late 2022 I made the decision to enrol at CodeClan Glasgow, for a 4-month intensive course in professional software development. It's been an incredible experince, it's built my knowledge, confidence and I've massively enjoyed it.",
        "I'm now actively looking for employment, if you'd like to get in touch please drop me a message on LinkedIn or send an email, I'm always available for a chat."
